# InterviewTestProject

## Short description

The purpose of this task is to check a general understanding and possibility to implement basic manipulations with WinForms controls.

There are a solution file and project files inside of folder **WindowsFormsSample1**. Also, you can find in **WindowsFormsSample1\ExpectedResult** the executable file of the SampleApllication. By running this application, you can look at what is expected to be as a final result during implementing this task.

All required code should be added to **MainForm.cs**. It is not required to change the structure of the listed methods. Just add necessary  logic to follow the requirements. Inside you will find blocks like:

- **// TODO some text**
   it defines the task which should be done within this method.

- **// comments after TODO**
   here it is listed what should be implemented, and some hits how or what use

- **// CODE goes here**
    it is a place where the implementation  should be done

### TODO

1. Implement logic that fills up the checkListBox with items. The count of items equals the counts of menu buttons. The checked state of items defines the visibility of the menu button.  **FillButtonsListBox()**
2. Implement logic that sets custom value DiplayName for item of checkListBox **SetMenuButtonsTranslation()**
3. Implement logic of changing the order of items checkedListBoxMenuButtons **MoveMenuButtonUp()** **MoveMenuButtonDown()**
